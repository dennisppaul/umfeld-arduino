# Umfeld in CLion

to run an *Umfeld* application as a *CMake* project in *CLion*[^1], follow these steps:

## macOS

everything should be in place if the *Quickstart* guide has been followed ( i.e applications can be compile in CLI ). just click `OK` when opening an new project.

## Windows

if MSYS2 has been installed correctly and the *Quickstart* guide has been followed ( i.e applications can be compile in CLI ) the only thing that NEEDS to be configured in *CLion* is the toolchain:

1. in `Settings… > Build, Execution, Deployment › Toolchains`
2. select `MinGW` toolchain
3. *CLion* comes with its own toolset but we need to change it to `UCRT64` installed with MSYS2
4. find the `Toolset:` field
5. point the toolset to `UCRT64` installed with MSYS2 ( default location is `C:\msys64\ucrt64` )
6. a green check symbol and the version number should appear
7. find the `CMake:` field
8. point it to the `cmake` installed by `UCRT64` ( default location is `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\cmake.exe` )
9. note, you may ignore the version warning

<!-- ## Linux -->

## Opening a Project

1. select `File > Open…` from the menu 
2. navigate to the folder ( or any parent folder ) that contains an *Umfeld* CMake script ( i.e `CMakeLists.txt` ) ( e.g `$PATH_TO_UMFELD/umfeld-examples` or `$PATH_TO_UMFELD/umfeld-examples/Basics/minimal` etcetera )
3. in the `Open Project Wizard` just press `OK`, optionally tick the `Reload CMake project on …`
4. *CLion* now opens all related resources ( if the CMake script is configured correctly )
5. find the CMake script `CMakeLists.txt` of the project in the `Project` view ( e.g `CMD+1` on macOS )
6. if necessary open `CMakeLists.txt` and adapt `set(UMFELD_PATH "[PATH_TO_UMFELD_FOLDER]")` to the folder containing *Umfeld* ( e.g the folder cloned from GitHub containing files like `install.sh`, `README.md` etcetera )
7. right-click on `CMakeLists.txt` and select `Load CMake Project` ( or `Reload CMake Project` if CLion already found the script automatically )
8. build and execute project by selecting `Run > Run 'my_project_name'` from the menu or by simply pressing the play button in the toolbar

## Updating Umfeld from GitHub in CLion

to keep *Umfeld* up to date, pull the latest version from GitHub before starting to work. either *right-click* on the *Umfeld* folders ( i.e `umfeld`, `umfeld-examples` and `umfeld-libraries` ) in *Project* view from the *Tool Windows* group ( `CMD+1` or folder icon ) and select `Git > Pull… > Pull` or select from the menu `Git > Pull… > Pull`.
